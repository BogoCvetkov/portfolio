# Stage 1 - Pre-Audit review (~ 1 day)
In the initial stage, you should provide access to the code that needs to be audited. I will spend a couple of hours on it to assess its complexity, size, and specifics. Any vulnerabilities found during this initial analysis will be described and reported free of charge. After that we'll discuss together your requirements, scope, and expectations. Finally, based on our discussion, I'll prepare a quote. If we agree on the conditions and down payment, the real audit starts!

# Stage 2 - Auditing your protocol (typically 1-2 weeks)
In this stage, I'll utilize all the depth of my expertise to meticulously review the code line by line and report every vulnerability that I find. Ultimately, I'll compile all findings into a report with detailed descriptions and mitigation recommendations.

# Stage 3 - Mitigation review (~ 1 week)
I'll collaborate with your team, answering questions and providing guidance as they apply fixes to the bugs that were chosen to be addressed. Once all fixes have been implemented, I'll thoroughly review each one to confirm that the issues have been mitigated correctly.

NOTE: Any additional development made by the team outside the scope of mitigating vulnerabilities will need to be discussed separately.
