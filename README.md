# About me

I'm Bogo!

A smart contract auditor with proven track record of consistently uncovering vulnerabilities in wide spectrum of DeFi protocols and performing exceptionally at multiple audit contests.

Having conducted more than 30 audits and uncovered numerous vulnerabilities, I continuously push the boundaries of my knowledge, striving to provide a superior level of expertise and maximize the value for each protocol I dedicate myself to!

This repository should serve as a testament to the statements above!
