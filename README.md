# About me
I'm Bogo! 

A smart contract auditor with proven track record of consistently uncovering vulnerabilities in wide specturm of DeFi protocols and performing exceptionally at multiple audit contests.

Having conducted more than 15 audits and uncovered over 30 vulnerabilities, I continuously push the boundaries of my knowledge, striving to provide a superior level of expertise and maximize the value for each protocol I dedicate myself to!

This repository should serve as a testament to the statements above!
